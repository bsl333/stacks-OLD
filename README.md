### Stretch Goals

For both stacks and queues, add a MAX_SIZE so that no other items can be added
if a stack/queue has reached MAX_SIZE

Create a method named `isFull()` that returns true if the stack/queue has reached
MAX_SIZE

If a stack/queue is full, any attempts to add to it should return a null/undefined.

Create tests for your new function
